# Lab utilization and management - PROJECT 1

The SS University Lab Booking System is a web-based application that allows university staff to book laboratory sessions efficiently. It provides an intuitive interface where users can select a lab, specify the date and time, enter the number of students, and confirm bookings. The system ensures better resource management, reduces scheduling conflicts, and improves the utilization of university laboratories.(we didn't connect it to a data base).
